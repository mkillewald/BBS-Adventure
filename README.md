# BBS Adventure v0.1
This is Adventure written in ARexx for use as a C-Net/5 P-file

![Adventure](https://github.com/mkillewald/BBS-Adventure/blob/master/screenshots/Adventure.png)

### Installation
1. Copy Adventure to an appropriate folder on your system such as Pfiles:Adventure/ 
2. Add a new ARexx door using the path you created in step 1 (i.e. Pfiles:/Adventure/Adventure)
3. Run the newly created P-file
4. Thats it!


### Note: 
This is unreleased 99% completed code. There are mentions to this being a Phenom Productions release as that was my intent, but life had other plans. I have not touched this code in a few years now. I no longer have a BBS up and running to try this out, but it should still work and be playable. I believe there were some item interactions that needed to be worked out still (i.e. items passing over one another would erase portions of one or the other. A manual screen refresh (press R in game) will re-draw the erased portions/item).
